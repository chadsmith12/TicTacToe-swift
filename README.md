# Tic-Tac-Toe In Swift

This project shows a very basic Tic Tac Toe Game made in SwiftUI, with some basic AI. Currently the AI will attempt the following logic when it is its turn:

* If it has a win, take it
* It it can block, block
* If it can take the middle square, take it
* Otherwise, pick a random square left

This keeps the AI beatable with some randomness, but at least can bring some challenge to the user to pay attention and make the right moves.
